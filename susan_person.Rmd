#Research

Brought up in the French School of `Data Analysis` (Analyse des Donn√©es) in the 1980's, I specialize in exploring and visualizing complex biological data.

I am interested in integrating the information provided by phylogenetic trees, community interaction graphs and metabolic networks with sequencing data and clinical covariates. 

I use computational statistics, in particular, nonparametric computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC to draw inferences about many complex biological phenomena, interactions between the immune system and cancer, resilience in the human microbiome after antibiotic use and drug resistance in HIV. 

I enjoy teaching using R and BioConductor and try to make everything I do freely available.

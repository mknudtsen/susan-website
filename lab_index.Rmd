We use computational statistics, multitable and nonparametric methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC computation of complex posterior distributions to draw inferences about complex biological phenomena such as:

*   complex dynamics and interactions in the immune system.
*   ant colonies.
*   drug resistant mutations in HIV.
*   differential geometrical approaches to statistics.
*   brain development through image analysis and genetics.
*   the dynamics of the human microbiome.
*   understanding resilience after perturbations.
